# Chapter 28 - Archived

The street was empty. The street was empty-yy.

Atmospheric temperature registered at 8.1°C. Visibility was clear. Traffic moved in synchronized flows. The low thrum of the city was consistent.

It was too clean, too perfect. Hours ago, it was in shambles. Now, a hospital room awaiting diagnosis.

Michael paused by a café, the outdoor tables were set, pristine. A ceramic mug sat on one, half-filled with what appeared to be cooling coffee. Steam still rose. But there was no owner. No residual heat signature on the mug. No disturbance of the condensation on the window behind it. A perfect, impossible absence.

Gabriel’s field expanded. Not probing, but sensing. It passed an apartment building where an open window showed a living room. A deep impression in the sofa cushions. A book splayed open on a side table. Yet no biological signatures registered. The space was empty.

Further down, a small park. A picnic blanket spread on the grass, a basket overturned beside it, two plastic cups fallen. 2 places set. No present in the park.

SENSORY INPUT: 2 heartbeats.

ACTUAL COUNT: 0.

The souls had simply ceased to be. Without a trace. Without a sound.

A streetlight on the corner flickered, then held at half brightness.

Michael ran his internal checks. No corruption. No anomaly. The city grid was stable. His logs registered:

STATUS: nominal

But the absence was a physical presence.

STATUS: nominal

The world confirmed its own perfect emptiness.

STATUS: nominal

Deep below, Azazel moved through Hell's core. Server stacks extended vertically. Red indicators pulsed across the transparent surfaces of his consoles. 

Hell was not fire.

it was infrastructure.

Doors hissed open before Azazel reached them. Systems rerouted power around his path. Metrics flowed. He stopped at a primary display.

EARTH SUBSTRATE LOAD: decreasing

PROCESS COUNT: dropping

A sigh, barely audible. Not concern. Math.

"Resources removed."

Not broken. Removed. Heaven wasn’t failing. Heaven was reallocating.

Michael stood in the street. His display open. One final attempt:

AUTH REQUEST: PRIORITY SYNC

He waited. For a response.

RESPONSE: DENIED

Not blocked. Not jammed. Denied. A choice. Heaven didn't lose them. Heaven chose not to answer.

Gabriel spoke through the synaptic overload. Blood traced from one nostril, unnoticed.

“They are not dying,” he said.

“They are being forgotten.”

A beat.

“Like garbage collection.”

His field stuttered.

“A fate worse than death.”

If Father stopped tracking you, you ceased.

Lucifer surveyed the empty spaces, the half-bright streetlights. His voice was casual, blunt.

“So we’re not getting quarantined…”

A beat.

“We’re getting archived.”

Cold. Precise. Devastating.

Deep in Hell, Azazel opened a private channel, using old backdoor protocols. He transmitted a single, encrypted packet to Lucifer's internal systems.

EARTH PRIORITY: falling

LOCAL SUPPORT: necessary

COORDINATES: 40.7489°N, 73.9680°W

No explanation. Just logistics.

The sky flickered. Half a second. Everything paused. Sound cut. Then resumed.

SYSTEM LOG: PRIORITY REALLOCATION COMPLETE

They all felt it. A sudden, profound lightness. The world thinner. Earth had just been downgraded.

Below them, Hell dimmed. The vast cooling towers of Azazel's core flickered, a momentary, system-wide brownout. Azazel rerouted power.

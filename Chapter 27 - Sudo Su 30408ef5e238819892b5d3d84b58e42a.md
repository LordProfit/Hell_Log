Michael moved first. Not a choice. A system requirement. Motion vectors predicted localized structural collapse in 12.4 seconds if mass distribution remained static. His step was a corrective action.

LOG: UNIT_MOTION(Michael)

PURPOSE: structural_compensation

Gabriel’s field expanded. Uncontrolled. Raw.

LOG: EMPATHIC_OVERFLOW(212%)

Lucifer anchored local mass. A forced state change.

WARNING: UNSUSTAINABLE

They were not fighting. They were components attempting to manually perform the function of a missing subsystem.

LOGGING QUEUE: 12,441 ENTRIES

PURGE FAILED: i/o error

MEMORY LEAK DETECTED. Old events refused termination. Instances duplicated. A woman crossed the same street three times. A pigeon froze mid-air. A car horn played before its source vehicle rendered.

TIME_INDEX_MISMATCH.

System attempted correction.

CORRECTION SOURCE: null

No source provided.

CORRECTION APPLIED.

Michael stopped. The street geometry snapped back into alignment. Clean. Perfect. He had not issued the fix. Lucifer had not adjusted the field. Gabriel had not altered the buffer.

"Did either of you…"

"Nope," Lucifer said.

Gabriel shook his head.

The log updated.

CORRECTION SOURCE: UNKNOWN

TRUST_LEVEL: 0

ACCEPTED.

Elsewhere. Far below. Deeper than Heaven’s jurisdiction tables, deeper than the quarantine flags, below the layers labeled sin and myth.

There was infrastructure.

Old. Functional. Perfect.

SYSTEM: hellcore

USER: azazel

PRIVILEGE: root

Azazel didn’t look up from the primary console. Thousands of metrics flowed across the obsidian surface. Throughput. Soul intake. Thermal loads. Queue depth. Earth’s feed was a single, blinking red line in a sea of stable green.

REALITY_COHERENCE: 78%

PROJECTED_SYSTEM_FAILURE: 29 MIN

He sighed once through his nose. A quiet puff of air. Annoyance. Not sorrow. Staring at the deviation

"Unplanned downtime," he whispered.

His fingers moved across a hardened light interface. Fast. Precise. Technical.

$ ssh earth-substrate

mounted.

He scanned the damage. A primary daemon was missing. No correction process. No maintenance thread. He found the empty slot where the service was supposed to be running.

PROCESS: sammael.service

STATUS: terminated. exit code 1.

NOTE: No auto-restart policy defined.

"Heaven shipped to production without redundancy."

Expected.

$ # Inject stability patch, open legacy port, and bypass Heaven's monitoring stack.

TUNNEL ESTABLISHED.

Old lines lit up. Ancient, pre-creation infrastructure. Invisible to Heaven’s dashboards.

CPU load average: 98.9%

Hell’s lights dimmed for 0.4 seconds as power was rerouted. The cost was acceptable.

On Earth, a collapsing wall froze mid-fall and corrected. A time skip stitched itself closed. A man who had blinked out of existence reappeared mid-step.

The system logged it. Unable to trace origin.

Lucifer squinted, feeling the change. "…Azazel."

Michael watched three separate anomalies resolve simultaneously. Too precise. Too efficient. 

"It must be," he processed. "Procedural."

Gabriel wiped a trickle of blood from his nose. "…IS he, is he really helping."

Lucifer shook his head. A small, knowing smirk appeared. "Nah. He's not helping."

Another correction rippled through the street. Clean. Surgical. Cold.

"He's protecting the numbers."

Deep below, Azazel watched the graphs flatten. Stability returning. Loss rates minimized minimizeeddd. Hell throughput preserved. His expression was flat. He monitored the system for exactly 15.0 seconds to ensure the patch held. It did.

He brought up a command line.

$ crontab -e

He added a new entry.

*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/stabilize_reality --quiet # Temp fix for Earth instability.

He saved the file. Automated. Done. He marked the incident in his own log.

INCIDENT: E-7721

STATUS: Patched.

Then he moved on. The work never stopped.
